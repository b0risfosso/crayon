• Name: Automated Method for Registering Dynamic Surfaces  
• Description: This system is a proposed automated technique designed to register dynamic surfaces that have the topology of a cylinder but can have complex geometry. It is also intended to classify the signatures of tissue deformation that occur during organ-scale shape change.  
• Action: The text proposes this method as a tool for accurately recording and analyzing tissue deformation patterns, which occur during changes in the shape of organs with cylindrical topology.  
• Keywords: automated method, registering dynamic surfaces, cylinder topology, complex geometry, tissue deformation, organ-scale shape change, classification, signatures, geometry, topology.

• Name: Particle Image Velocimetry (Phase Correlation Analysis)  
• Description: Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) is a method used for capturing material motion. Phase correlation analysis is used within PIV to measure motion relative to the previous timepoint.  
• Action: The text discusses stabilizing resulting coordinates using the metric J, based on material motion measured through PIV. This implies a process where the motion is analyzed and then applied to adjust coordinates for consistency over time.  
• Keywords: Particle Image Velocimetry, Phase Correlation Analysis, Material Motion, J, Coordinate Stabilization, Measurement, Previous Timepoint, Motion Analysis

• Name — ImSAnE cartographic projections
• Description — ImSAnE is a system that generates high-quality cartographic projections by dividing a surface into multiple coordinate patches. It operates at any given timepoint, which allows for detailed mapping of surfaces in this context.
• Action — The text discusses the challenge posed by tissue motion within and between coordinate patches generated by ImSAnE. This motion is unconstrained between timepoints, creating difficulties in tracking and interpreting cell and tissue motion in dynamic geometries.
• Keywords — ImSAnE, cartographic projections, coordinate patches, surface division, tissue motion, cell tracking, dynamic geometries, timepoints, motion interpretation, challenges.

• name — Cylindrical Topology
• description — The text refers to surfaces that have a cylindrical topology, which indicates that these surfaces have characteristics or properties akin to that of a cylinder.
• action — The text states that certain conditions or processes result in the formation of surfaces that possess a cylindrical topology.
• keywords — surfaces, cylindrical, topology, formation, properties, characteristics, geometry, structure, shape, cylindrical surfaces
