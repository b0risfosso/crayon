I'm unable to extract any systems or concepts from the provided text. Please provide more context or information for analysis.

The provided text "U.S.A." does not contain sufficient information to extract systems, concepts, or objects as defined by your request.

• Name: DE-Cad
• Description: DE-Cad refers to a molecule involved in staining of the hindgut epithelium. It is part of a process where an antibody against DE-Cad is used.
• Action: In the text, DE-Cad is targeted by an antibody to stain the hindgut epithelium, indicating its role in cellular or tissue processes within this context.
• Keywords: DE-Cad, antibody, hindgut, epithelium, staining, molecule, cellular processes, tissue, anti-DE-Cad, immunostaining.

I'm sorry, without further text provided from the document by Noselli in Nature 440, 803 (2006), I cannot extract any systems, concepts, or objects. Please provide more detailed or specific text to proceed with the analysis.

I'm sorry, but there is no clear system or concept provided within the text "26." It appears to be an incomplete or isolated fragment with no additional context or information to analyze.

• name — DE-Cad and MyoID
• description — These are required in the process before the left-handed rotation of the hindgut epithelium. However, they are not required during the actual rotation process.
• action — DE-Cad and MyoID are necessary for initiating preparations for the left-handed rotation but are not active during the execution of this rotation in the hindgut epithelium.
• keywords — DE-Cad, MyoID, left-handed rotation, hindgut epithelium, LR bias, epithelial remodeling, cell-boundary constriction, simulation, Fig. 4D′, Fig. 4D″

• name — Angle description in cell boundary labeling
• description — The text describes a method to define the angle between a cell boundary, labeled with anti-PY20 (magenta), and the anterior-posterior (AP) axis, denoted by a yellow arrow. The angle is represented as x° and shown as a turquoise arc.
• action — This process involves measuring and defining the angle between known cellular structures and axes using a label and color-coded visual representation.
• keywords - cell boundary, anti-PY20, angle, AP axis, labeling, turquoise arc, magenta, yellow arrow, x°

- Name: Shotgun (shg) Mutations
- Description: Specific mutations (shgR758, shgR1232, and shgR69, a null allele) that have been found to disrupt the laterality of the hindgut.
- Action: These mutations affect the normal development or arrangement of the hindgut, disrupting its laterality, as evidenced by fig. S1.
- Keywords: Shotgun, shg mutations, shgR758, shgR1232, shgR69, null allele, hindgut, laterality, disruption, mutation effect, fig. S1.
