  • Action: The double-stranded RNA expression is part of a mechanism to study or manipulate the Myo31DF mRNA, potentially in relation to gene silencing or interference.  
  • Keywords: double-stranded RNA, Myo31DF mRNA, expression, gene silencing, RNA interference, Myo31DF, mRNA

• Name: GFP–moesin  
  • Description: GFP–moesin is a fusion protein that includes green fluorescent protein (GFP) and moesin, utilized for visualization and tracking in biological studies.  
  • Action: Expressing GFP–moesin in a temporally specific manner allows researchers to study cellular processes over time, tracking the moesin protein within cells using GFP as a fluorescent marker.  
  • Keywords: GFP–moesin, green fluorescent protein, moesin, expression, visualization, protein tracking, fluorescent marker

The provided text "Biol." does not contain enough information or context to extract any systems or concepts. Please provide a more detailed text for analysis.

• name — Myo31DFL152
• description — Myo31DFL152 is one of five alleles induced by the chemical ethylmethanesulfonate (EMS) and is associated with the Myo31DF gene. These alleles were identified through a large-scale mutant screen.
• action — The text states that Myo31DFL152 was isolated as part of a broader effort to identify mutations, utilizing EMS, to induce and isolate these alleles for study. This indicates an ongoing study of genetic mutations related to Myo31DF.
• keywords — Myo31DFL152, EMS, allele, ethylmethanesulfonate, mutant screen, Myo31DF, genetics, mutation, isolation, large-scale

• Name: GFP-labelled Nucleus Visualization  
• Description: This system involves visualizing the position of each cell by labeling the nucleus with Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP).  
• Action: The text describes the labeling of cell nuclei with GFP to make their positions visible, highlighting a method for tracking or observing cellular positions.  
• Keywords: GFP, nucleus, cell position, visualization, labeling, fluorescence, cellular tracking

• Name: Temperature-sensitive GAL80
  • Description: GAL80 is a suppressor of the GAL4 protein. In this context, the GAL80 used is temperature-sensitive, meaning its suppressive activity can be regulated by changing the temperature.
  • Action: The temperature-sensitive GAL80 controls the activity of GAL4 driven by a byn-Gal4 driver. This suggests that the expression or activity of GAL4 can be modulated depending on the temperature, due to the influence of GAL80.
  • Keywords: GAL80, GAL4, temperature-sensitive, suppressor, byn-Gal4, regulation, activity control

• Name: GAL4
  • Description: GAL4 is a protein whose activity is being driven by a byn-Gal4 construct. It's a common yeast transcription factor used in genetic studies for its ability to activate transcription.
  • Action: GAL4's activity is regulated by a temperature-sensitive GAL80, allowing precise control over the expression mediated by GAL4.
  • Keywords: GAL4, transcription factor, genetic control, regulation, byn-Gal4, expression control, protein activity

• Name: byn-Gal4
  • Description: byn-Gal4 is a genetic construct used to drive the activity of GAL4. It specifies the conditions or spatial/temporal expression where GAL4 acts.
  • Action: byn-Gal4 drives GAL4's activity, and this activity is further modulated by the presence of a temperature-sensitive GAL80 suppressor.
  • Keywords: byn-Gal4, genetic construct, GAL4 activation, gene expression, transcription regulation, driver, GAL4 system

• Name: NP5021-driven UAS-GFPnls  
• Description: A genetic construct used in live embryos, where the NP5021 driver is used to express UAS-GFPnls across the whole gut.  
• Action: The system involves the expression of GFP (green fluorescent protein) within live embryos to visualize certain aspects within the whole gut. The embryos are then prepared for observation by mounting them with FL-100.  
• Keywords: NP5021, UAS-GFPnls, live embryos, whole gut, gene expression, fluorescent protein, GFP, FL-100, Shin-Etsu Chemical Co., mounting.
