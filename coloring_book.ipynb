      "the applications of the method are explored, in the context of plant\n",
      "genetic engineering, in Chapter 16. Elsewhere, the continuing\n",

      "For the first 30 years of its life, this new science grew at an astonishing\n",

      "W. Sutton in 1903, and received experimental backing from T.H.\n",

      "Despite the brilliance of these classical genetic studies, there was no\n",

      "Indeed, it was not until the experiments of Avery, MacLeod, and\n",

      "1.3 What is gene cloning?\n",
      "What exactly is gene cloning? The easiest way to answer this question\n",
      "is to follow through the steps in a gene cloning experiment (Figure\n",
      "1.1):\n",
      "1. A fragment of DNA, containing the gene to be cloned, is inserted\n",
      "into a circular DNA molecule called a vector, to produce a\n",
      "recombinant DNA molecule.\n",
      "2. The vector transports the gene into a host cell, which is usually a\n",
      "bacterium, although other types of living cell can be used.\n",
      "3. Within the host cell the vector multiplies, producing numerous\n",
      "identical copies, not only of itself but also of the gene that it\n",
      "carries.\n",
      "4. When the host cell divides, copies of the recombinant DNA\n",
      "molecule are passed to the progeny and further vector replication\n",
      "takes place.\n",
      "5. After a large number of cell divisions, a colony, or clone, of\n",
      "identical host cells is produced. Each cell in the clone contains one\n",
      "or more copies of the recombinant DNA molecule. The gene\n",
      "carried by the recombinant molecule is now said to be cloned.\n",
      "1.4 What is PCR?\n",
      "The polymerase chain reaction is very different from gene cloning.\n",
      "Rather than a series of manipulations involving living cells, PCR is\n",
      "carried out in a single test tube simply by mixing DNA with a set of\n",
      "reagents and placing the tube in a thermal cycler, a piece of equipment\n",
      "that enables the mixture to be incubated at a series of temperatures\n",
      "that are varied in a preprogrammed manner. The basic steps in a PCR\n",
      "experiment are as follows (Figure 1.2):\n",
      "Figure 1.1 The basic steps in gene cloning.\n",
      "1. The mixture is heated to 94°C, at which temperature the hydrogen\n",
      "bonds that hold together the two strands of the double stranded\n",
      "DNA molecule are broken, causing the molecule to denature.\n",
      "2. The mixture is cooled down to 50–60°C. The two strands of each\n",
      "molecule could join back together at this temperature, but most\n",
      "do not because the mixture contains a large excess of short DNA\n",
      "molecules, called oligonucleotides or primers, which anneal\n",
      "to the DNA molecules at specific positions.\n",
      "3. The temperature is raised to 74°C. This is a good working\n",
      "temperature for the Taq DNA polymerase that is present in the\n",
      "mixture. We will learn more about DNA polymerases in Section\n",
      "4.1.3. All we need to understand at this stage is that the Taq DNA\n",
      "polymerase attaches to one end of each primer and synthesizes\n",
      "new strands of DNA, complementary to the template DNA\n",
      "molecules, during this step of the PCR. Now we have four stands\n",
      "of DNA instead of the two that there were to start with.\n",
      "Figure 1.2 The basic steps in the polymerase chain reaction.\n",
      "4. The temperature is increased back to 94°C. The double stranded\n",
      "DNA molecules, each of which consists of one strand of the\n",
      "original molecule and one new strand of DNA, denature into\n",
      "single strands. This begins a second cycle of denaturation–\n",
      "annealing–synthesis, at the end of which there are eight DNA\n",
      "strands. By repeating the cycle 30 times the double stranded\n",
      "molecule that we began with is converted into over 130 million\n",
      "new double stranded molecules, each one a copy of the region of\n",

      "primers.\n",
      "1.5 Why gene cloning and PCR are so\n",
      "important\n",
      "As you can see from Figures 1.1 and 1.2, gene cloning and PCR are\n",
      "relatively straightforward procedures. Why, then, have they assumed\n",
      "such importance in biology? The answer is largely because both\n",
      "techniques can provide a pure sample of an individual gene, separated\n",
      "from all the other genes in the cell.\n",
      "1.5.1 Obtaining a pure sample of a gene by cloning\n",
      "To understand exactly how cloning can provide a pure sample of a\n",
      "gene, consider the basic experiment from Figure 1.1, but drawn in a\n",
      "slightly different way (Figure 1.3). In this example the DNA fragment\n",
      "to be cloned is one member of a mixture of many different fragments,\n",
      "each carrying a different gene or part of a gene. This mixture could\n",
      "indeed be the entire genetic complement of an organism – a human,\n",
      "for instance. Each of these fragments becomes inserted into a different\n",
      "vector molecule to produce a family of recombinant DNA molecules,\n",
      "one of which carries the gene of interest. Usually only one\n",
      "recombinant DNA molecule is transported into any single host cell, so\n",
      "that although the final set of clones may contain many different\n",
      "recombinant DNA molecules, each individual clone contains multiple\n",
      "copies of just one molecule. The gene is now separated away from all\n",
      "the other genes in the original mixture, and its specific features can be\n",
      "studied in detail.\n",
      "Figure 1.3 Cloning allows individual fragments of DNA to be purified.\n",
      "In practice, the key to the success or failure of a gene cloning\n",
