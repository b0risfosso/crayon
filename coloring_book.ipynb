      "editing as a tool in both research and biotechnology. The basic\n",
      "methodology for CRISPR editing is now described in Chapter 12 and\n",
      "the applications of the method are explored, in the context of plant\n",
      "genetic engineering, in Chapter 16. Elsewhere, the continuing\n",
      "evolution of next generation DNA sequencing is reflected by a\n",
      "reorganization of this part of Chapter 10, and to deal with the further\n",
      "proliferation of methods for studying transcriptomes and proteomes\n",
      "(albeit not strictly DNA Analysis) I have created a new chapter\n",
      "devoted to these methods. Other additions include new sections on\n",
      "melt curve analysis of real time PCR products and genetic typing of\n",
      "human disease mutations.\n",
      "I wrote the First Edition of Gene Cloning in 1985, shortly after gaining\n",

      "unable to track one down. I have written this latest Edition during the\n",
      "months immediately following my retirement from academia. I would\n",
      "like to thank the many colleagues, students, and email contacts who,\n",
      "over those 35 years have made comments and suggestions about the\n",
      "content of the book and the way the material is presented. In\n",
      "particular, I would like to thank Mehdi Evazalipour of Guilan Medical\n",

      "rules to explain the inheritance of biological characteristics. The basic\n",

      "particle present somewhere in the cell. The rediscovery of Mendel’s\n",

      "understanding what these genes are and exactly how they work.\n",
      "1.1 The early development of genetics\n",
      "For the first 30 years of its life, this new science grew at an astonishing\n",
      "rate. The idea that genes reside on chromosomes was proposed by\n",
      "W. Sutton in 1903, and received experimental backing from T.H.\n",
      "Morgan in 1910. Morgan and his colleagues then developed the\n",
      "techniques for gene mapping, and by 1922 had produced a\n",
      "comprehensive analysis of the relative positions of over 2000 genes on\n",
      "the four chromosomes of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster.\n",
      "Despite the brilliance of these classical genetic studies, there was no\n",
      "real understanding of the molecular nature of the gene until the 1940s.\n",
      "Indeed, it was not until the experiments of Avery, MacLeod, and\n",
      "McCarty in 1944, and of Hershey and Chase in 1952, that anyone\n",
      "believed that deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is the genetic material. Up\n",
      "until then it was widely thought that genes were made of protein. The\n",
      "discovery of the role of DNA was a tremendous stimulus to genetic\n",
      "research, and many famous biologists (Delbrück, Chargaff, Crick, and\n",
      "Monod were among the most influential) contributed to the second\n",
      "great age of genetics. In the 14 years between 1952 and 1966, the\n",
      "structure of DNA was elucidated, the genetic code cracked, and the\n",
      "processes of transcription and translation described.\n",
      "1.2 The advent of gene cloning and the\n",
      "polymerase chain reaction\n",
      "These years of activity and discovery were followed by a lull, a period\n",
      "of anticlimax, when it seemed to some molecular biologists (as the new\n",
      "generation of geneticists styled themselves) that there was little of\n",
      "fundamental importance that was not understood. In truth there was a\n",
      "frustration that the experimental techniques of the late 1960s were not\n",
      "sophisticated enough to allow genes to be studied in any greater detail.\n",
      "Then, in the years 1971–1973 genetic research was thrown back into\n",

      "century with the massive genome sequencing projects, including the\n",
      "human project which was completed in 2000. They led to procedures\n",
      "for studying the regulation of individual genes, which have allowed\n",

      "have passed since the dawning of the age of gene cloning, but we are\n",
      "still riding the rollercoaster and there is no end to the excitement in\n",
      "sight.\n",
      "1.3 What is gene cloning?\n",
      "What exactly is gene cloning? The easiest way to answer this question\n",
      "is to follow through the steps in a gene cloning experiment (Figure\n",
      "1.1):\n",
      "1. A fragment of DNA, containing the gene to be cloned, is inserted\n",
      "into a circular DNA molecule called a vector, to produce a\n",
      "recombinant DNA molecule.\n",
      "2. The vector transports the gene into a host cell, which is usually a\n",
      "bacterium, although other types of living cell can be used.\n",
      "3. Within the host cell the vector multiplies, producing numerous\n",
      "identical copies, not only of itself but also of the gene that it\n",
      "carries.\n",
      "4. When the host cell divides, copies of the recombinant DNA\n",
      "molecule are passed to the progeny and further vector replication\n",
      "takes place.\n",
      "5. After a large number of cell divisions, a colony, or clone, of\n",
      "identical host cells is produced. Each cell in the clone contains one\n",
      "or more copies of the recombinant DNA molecule. The gene\n",
      "carried by the recombinant molecule is now said to be cloned.\n",
      "1.4 What is PCR?\n",
      "The polymerase chain reaction is very different from gene cloning.\n",
      "Rather than a series of manipulations involving living cells, PCR is\n",
      "carried out in a single test tube simply by mixing DNA with a set of\n",
      "reagents and placing the tube in a thermal cycler, a piece of equipment\n",
      "that enables the mixture to be incubated at a series of temperatures\n",
      "that are varied in a preprogrammed manner. The basic steps in a PCR\n",
      "experiment are as follows (Figure 1.2):\n",
      "Figure 1.1 The basic steps in gene cloning.\n",
      "1. The mixture is heated to 94°C, at which temperature the hydrogen\n",
      "bonds that hold together the two strands of the double stranded\n",
      "DNA molecule are broken, causing the molecule to denature.\n",
      "2. The mixture is cooled down to 50–60°C. The two strands of each\n",
      "molecule could join back together at this temperature, but most\n",
      "do not because the mixture contains a large excess of short DNA\n",
      "molecules, called oligonucleotides or primers, which anneal\n",
      "to the DNA molecules at specific positions.\n",
      "3. The temperature is raised to 74°C. This is a good working\n",
      "temperature for the Taq DNA polymerase that is present in the\n",
      "mixture. We will learn more about DNA polymerases in Section\n",
      "4.1.3. All we need to understand at this stage is that the Taq DNA\n",
      "polymerase attaches to one end of each primer and synthesizes\n",
      "new strands of DNA, complementary to the template DNA\n",
      "molecules, during this step of the PCR. Now we have four stands\n",
      "of DNA instead of the two that there were to start with.\n",
      "Figure 1.2 The basic steps in the polymerase chain reaction.\n",
      "4. The temperature is increased back to 94°C. The double stranded\n",
      "DNA molecules, each of which consists of one strand of the\n",
      "original molecule and one new strand of DNA, denature into\n",
      "single strands. This begins a second cycle of denaturation–\n",
      "annealing–synthesis, at the end of which there are eight DNA\n",
      "strands. By repeating the cycle 30 times the double stranded\n",
      "molecule that we began with is converted into over 130 million\n",
      "new double stranded molecules, each one a copy of the region of\n",
      "the starting molecule delineated by the annealing sites of the two\n",
      "primers.\n",
      "1.5 Why gene cloning and PCR are so\n",
      "important\n",
      "As you can see from Figures 1.1 and 1.2, gene cloning and PCR are\n",
      "relatively straightforward procedures. Why, then, have they assumed\n",
      "such importance in biology? The answer is largely because both\n",
      "techniques can provide a pure sample of an individual gene, separated\n",
      "from all the other genes in the cell.\n",
      "1.5.1 Obtaining a pure sample of a gene by cloning\n",
      "To understand exactly how cloning can provide a pure sample of a\n",
      "gene, consider the basic experiment from Figure 1.1, but drawn in a\n",
      "slightly different way (Figure 1.3). In this example the DNA fragment\n",
      "to be cloned is one member of a mixture of many different fragments,\n",
      "each carrying a different gene or part of a gene. This mixture could\n",
      "indeed be the entire genetic complement of an organism – a human,\n",
      "for instance. Each of these fragments becomes inserted into a different\n",
      "vector molecule to produce a family of recombinant DNA molecules,\n",
      "one of which carries the gene of interest. Usually only one\n",
      "recombinant DNA molecule is transported into any single host cell, so\n",
      "that although the final set of clones may contain many different\n",
      "recombinant DNA molecules, each individual clone contains multiple\n",
      "copies of just one molecule. The gene is now separated away from all\n",
      "the other genes in the original mixture, and its specific features can be\n",
      "studied in detail.\n",
      "Figure 1.3 Cloning allows individual fragments of DNA to be purified.\n",
      "In practice, the key to the success or failure of a gene cloning\n",
      "experiment is the ability to identify the particular clone of interest\n",
      "from the many different ones that are obtained. If we consider the\n",
      "genome of the bacterium Escherichia coli, which contains just over\n",
      "4000 different genes, we might at first despair of being able to find\n",

Here’s a detailed description of their relationship and the strength of this relationship:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Relationship:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Complementary Processes:**\n",
      "   - **Spin Column Chromatography System** is a tool used in the initial stages of molecular biology workflows to purify nucleic acids from cell lysates. This purification is crucial for obtaining high-quality DNA or RNA free from contaminants that could interfere with subsequent analyses.\n",
      "   - **Ancient DNA Analysis** requires the extraction and purification of DNA from ancient specimens. Given the degraded and often contaminated nature of ancient DNA, purification is a critical step to ensure the accuracy of downstream genetic analyses.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Sequential Workflow:**\n",
      "   - In a typical workflow involving ancient DNA, a Spin Column Chromatography System might be employed after the initial extraction of DNA from ancient samples. This system would help to purify the DNA, removing inhibitors and contaminants that are common in ancient samples, thus preparing the DNA for sequencing and analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Shared Scientific Principles:**\n",
      "   - Both artifacts rely on fundamental principles of molecular biology. The Spin Column Chromatography System uses centrifugation and ion exchange chromatography, which are physical and chemical methods to separate molecules. Ancient DNA Analysis uses these purified molecules to perform genetic sequencing and analysis based on principles of genetics.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strength of the Relationship:\n",
      "\n",
      "The strength of the relationship between these two artifacts is **moderate to strong** due to their complementary nature in the workflow of DNA analysis. The Spin Column Chromatography System is integral to preparing high-quality samples for Ancient DNA Analysis, which is crucial for obtaining reliable and accurate genetic information from ancient specimens. Without effective purification, the quality of the ancient DNA data could be compromised, directly affecting the outcomes of the analysis. Thus, while they serve different roles, their interdependence in the context of ancient DNA studies is significant.\n"
