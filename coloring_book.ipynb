      "In the middle of the 19th century, Gregor Mendel formulated a set of\n",
      "rules to explain the inheritance of biological characteristics. The basic\n",
      "assumption of these rules is that each heritable property of an\n",
      "organism is controlled by a factor, called a gene, that is a physical\n",
      "particle present somewhere in the cell. The rediscovery of Mendel’s\n",
      "laws in 1900 marks the birth of genetics, the science aimed at\n",
      "understanding what these genes are and exactly how they work.\n",
      "1.1 The early development of genetics\n",
      "For the first 30 years of its life, this new science grew at an astonishing\n",
      "rate. The idea that genes reside on chromosomes was proposed by\n",
      "W. Sutton in 1903, and received experimental backing from T.H.\n",
      "Morgan in 1910. Morgan and his colleagues then developed the\n",
      "techniques for gene mapping, and by 1922 had produced a\n",
      "comprehensive analysis of the relative positions of over 2000 genes on\n",
      "the four chromosomes of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster.\n",
      "Despite the brilliance of these classical genetic studies, there was no\n",
      "real understanding of the molecular nature of the gene until the 1940s.\n",
      "Indeed, it was not until the experiments of Avery, MacLeod, and\n",
      "McCarty in 1944, and of Hershey and Chase in 1952, that anyone\n",
      "believed that deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is the genetic material. Up\n",
      "until then it was widely thought that genes were made of protein. The\n",
      "discovery of the role of DNA was a tremendous stimulus to genetic\n",
      "research, and many famous biologists (Delbrück, Chargaff, Crick, and\n",
      "Monod were among the most influential) contributed to the second\n",
      "great age of genetics. In the 14 years between 1952 and 1966, the\n",
      "structure of DNA was elucidated, the genetic code cracked, and the\n",
      "processes of transcription and translation described.\n",
      "1.2 The advent of gene cloning and the\n",
      "polymerase chain reaction\n",
      "These years of activity and discovery were followed by a lull, a period\n",
      "of anticlimax, when it seemed to some molecular biologists (as the new\n",
      "generation of geneticists styled themselves) that there was little of\n",
      "fundamental importance that was not understood. In truth there was a\n",
      "frustration that the experimental techniques of the late 1960s were not\n",
      "sophisticated enough to allow genes to be studied in any greater detail.\n",
      "Then, in the years 1971–1973 genetic research was thrown back into\n",
      "gear by what at the time was described as a revolution in experimental\n",
      "biology. A whole new methodology was developed, enabling previously\n",
      "impossible experiments to be planned and carried out, if not with ease,\n",
      "then at least with success. These methods, referred to as\n",
      "recombinant DNA technology or genetic engineering, and\n",
      "having at their core the process of gene cloning, sparked another\n",
      "great age of genetics. They led to rapid and efficient DNA\n",
      "sequencing techniques that enabled the structures of individual\n",
      "genes to be determined, reaching a culmination at the turn of the\n",
      "century with the massive genome sequencing projects, including the\n",
      "human project which was completed in 2000. They led to procedures\n",
      "for studying the regulation of individual genes, which have allowed\n",
      "molecular biologists to understand how aberrations in gene activity\n",
      "can result in human diseases such as cancer. The techniques spawned\n",
      "modern biotechnology, which puts genes to work in production of\n",
      "proteins and other compounds needed in medicine and industrial\n",
      "processes.\n",
      "During the 1980s, when the excitement engendered by the gene\n",
      "cloning revolution was at its height, it hardly seemed possible that\n",
      "another, equally novel and equally revolutionary process was just\n",
      "around the corner. According to DNA folklore, Kary Mullis invented\n",
      "the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) during a drive along\n",
      "California State Route 128 from Berkeley to Mendocino one Friday\n",
      "evening in 1983. His brainwave was an exquisitely simple technique\n",
      "that acts as a perfect complement to gene cloning. PCR has made\n",
      "easier many of the techniques that were possible but difficult to carry\n",
      "out when gene cloning was used on its own. It has extended the range\n",
      "of DNA analysis and enabled molecular biology to find new\n",
      "applications in areas of endeavour outside of its traditional range of\n",
      "medicine, agriculture, and biotechnology. Archaeogenetics, molecular\n",
      "ecology, and DNA forensics are just three of the new disciplines that\n",
      "have become possible as a direct consequence of the invention of PCR,\n",
      "enabling molecular biologists to ask questions about human evolution\n",
      "and the impact of environmental change on the biosphere, and to\n",
      "bring their powerful tools to bear in the fight against crime. Fifty years\n",
      "have passed since the dawning of the age of gene cloning, but we are\n",
      "still riding the rollercoaster and there is no end to the excitement in\n",
      "sight.\n",
      "1.3 What is gene cloning?\n",
      "What exactly is gene cloning? The easiest way to answer this question\n",
      "is to follow through the steps in a gene cloning experiment (Figure\n",
      "1.1):\n",
      "1. A fragment of DNA, containing the gene to be cloned, is inserted\n",
      "into a circular DNA molecule called a vector, to produce a\n",
      "recombinant DNA molecule.\n",
      "2. The vector transports the gene into a host cell, which is usually a\n",
      "bacterium, although other types of living cell can be used.\n",
      "3. Within the host cell the vector multiplies, producing numerous\n",
      "identical copies, not only of itself but also of the gene that it\n",
      "carries.\n",
      "4. When the host cell divides, copies of the recombinant DNA\n",
      "molecule are passed to the progeny and further vector replication\n",
      "takes place.\n",
      "5. After a large number of cell divisions, a colony, or clone, of\n",
      "identical host cells is produced. Each cell in the clone contains one\n",
      "or more copies of the recombinant DNA molecule. The gene\n",
      "carried by the recombinant molecule is now said to be cloned.\n",
      "1.4 What is PCR?\n",
      "The polymerase chain reaction is very different from gene cloning.\n",
      "Rather than a series of manipulations involving living cells, PCR is\n",
      "carried out in a single test tube simply by mixing DNA with a set of\n",
      "reagents and placing the tube in a thermal cycler, a piece of equipment\n",
      "that enables the mixture to be incubated at a series of temperatures\n",
      "that are varied in a preprogrammed manner. The basic steps in a PCR\n",
      "experiment are as follows (Figure 1.2):\n",
      "Figure 1.1 The basic steps in gene cloning.\n",
      "1. The mixture is heated to 94°C, at which temperature the hydrogen\n",
      "bonds that hold together the two strands of the double stranded\n",
      "DNA molecule are broken, causing the molecule to denature.\n",
      "2. The mixture is cooled down to 50–60°C. The two strands of each\n",
      "molecule could join back together at this temperature, but most\n",
      "do not because the mixture contains a large excess of short DNA\n",
      "molecules, called oligonucleotides or primers, which anneal\n",
      "to the DNA molecules at specific positions.\n",
      "3. The temperature is raised to 74°C. This is a good working\n",
      "temperature for the Taq DNA polymerase that is present in the\n",
      "mixture. We will learn more about DNA polymerases in Section\n",
      "4.1.3. All we need to understand at this stage is that the Taq DNA\n",
      "polymerase attaches to one end of each primer and synthesizes\n",
      "new strands of DNA, complementary to the template DNA\n",
      "molecules, during this step of the PCR. Now we have four stands\n",
      "of DNA instead of the two that there were to start with.\n",
      "Figure 1.2 The basic steps in the polymerase chain reaction.\n",
      "4. The temperature is increased back to 94°C. The double stranded\n",
      "DNA molecules, each of which consists of one strand of the\n",
      "original molecule and one new strand of DNA, denature into\n",
      "single strands. This begins a second cycle of denaturation–\n",
      "annealing–synthesis, at the end of which there are eight DNA\n",
      "strands. By repeating the cycle 30 times the double stranded\n",
      "molecule that we began with is converted into over 130 million\n",
      "new double stranded molecules, each one a copy of the region of\n",
      "the starting molecule delineated by the annealing sites of the two\n",
      "primers.\n",
      "1.5 Why gene cloning and PCR are so\n",
      "important\n",
      "As you can see from Figures 1.1 and 1.2, gene cloning and PCR are\n",
      "relatively straightforward procedures. Why, then, have they assumed\n",
      "such importance in biology? The answer is largely because both\n",
      "techniques can provide a pure sample of an individual gene, separated\n",
      "from all the other genes in the cell.\n",
      "1.5.1 Obtaining a pure sample of a gene by cloning\n",
      "To understand exactly how cloning can provide a pure sample of a\n",
      "gene, consider the basic experiment from Figure 1.1, but drawn in a\n",
      "slightly different way (Figure 1.3). In this example the DNA fragment\n",
      "to be cloned is one member of a mixture of many different fragments,\n",
      "each carrying a different gene or part of a gene. This mixture could\n",
      "indeed be the entire genetic complement of an organism – a human,\n",
      "for instance. Each of these fragments becomes inserted into a different\n",
      "vector molecule to produce a family of recombinant DNA molecules,\n",
      "one of which carries the gene of interest. Usually only one\n",
      "recombinant DNA molecule is transported into any single host cell, so\n",
      "that although the final set of clones may contain many different\n",
      "recombinant DNA molecules, each individual clone contains multiple\n",
      "copies of just one molecule. The gene is now separated away from all\n",
      "the other genes in the original mixture, and its specific features can be\n",
      "studied in detail.\n",
      "Figure 1.3 Cloning allows individual fragments of DNA to be purified.\n",
      "In practice, the key to the success or failure of a gene cloning\n",
      "experiment is the ability to identify the particular clone of interest\n",
      "from the many different ones that are obtained. If we consider the\n",
      "genome of the bacterium Escherichia coli, which contains just over\n",
      "4000 different genes, we might at first despair of being able to find\n",
      "just one gene among all the possible clones (Figure 1.4). The problem\n",
      "becomes even more overwhelming wh\n"
