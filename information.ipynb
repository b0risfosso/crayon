    "Developmental biology has long drawn on dynamical systems to understand the diverging fates and the emerging form of the developing embryo. Cell differentiation and morphogenesis unfold in high-dimensional gene-expression spaces and position spaces. Yet, their stable and reproducible outcomes suggest low-dimensional geometric structures—e.g., fixed points, manifolds, and dynamic attracting and repelling structures—that organize cell trajectories in both spaces. This review surveys the history and recent advances in dynamical systems frameworks for development. We focus on techniques for extracting the organizing geometric structures of cell fate decisions and morphogenetic movements from experiments, as well as their interconnections. This unifying, dynamical systems perspective aids in rationalizing increasingly complex experimental datasets, facilitating principled dimensionality reduction and an integrated understanding of development, bridging typically distinct domains.\n",

      "Key Assumptions  \n",
      "1. Model system: Drosophila melanogaster embryos expressing live fluorescent reporters for cell membranes (e.g. E-cadherin–GFP) and nuclear or gene‐activity markers (e.g. MS2/MCP for hindgut‐specific transcripts).  \n",
      "2. Imaging infrastructure: multi-view light-sheet or high-speed confocal microscopy capable of sub‐minute volumetric acquisitions over 6–8 h of hindgut morphogenesis.  \n",
      "3. Computational resources: access to GPU clusters for deep learning segmentation and manifold‐learning algorithms.  \n",
      "4. Time‐scale: 12–18 months from protocol optimization to initial data analysis.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Theory/Method Outline  \n",
      "We treat the hindgut epithelium as a high‐dimensional dynamical system in which each cell’s state is defined by its shape descriptors, spatial coordinates, and gene‐expression levels. We seek the low‐dimensional manifolds and attractors that organize cell‐shape trajectories during folding and tube formation.  \n",
      "\n",
      "1. Sample Preparation & Live Imaging  \n",
      "   1.1. Generate Drosophila lines co-expressing membrane and nuclear reporters plus an MS2‐tagged hindgut‐specific gene (e.g.byn).  \n",
      "   1.2. Mount stage-10 embryos in low‐melting­-point agarose on a rotating sample holder.  \n",
      "   1.3. Acquire 3D image stacks every 30–60 s for 6–8 h (covering hindgut invagination to tube elongation).  \n",
      "\n",
      "2. Automated 4D Segmentation & Feature Extraction  \n",
      "   2.1. Use a U-Net or StarDist network trained on manually annotated frames to segment individual epithelial cells in 3D.  \n",
      "   2.2. For each cell and time point, compute a feature vector x(t) that includes:  \n",
      "       – Shape descriptors: apical area, aspect ratio, curvature, cortical intensity gradients.  \n",
      "       – Positional coordinates: center-of-mass (x,y,z) relative to hindgut midline.  \n",
      "       – Gene‐expression proxies: nuclear MS2 spots count/intensity.  \n",
      "   2.3. Assemble trajectories {x_i(t)} for N≈10^3–10^4 cells.  \n",
      "\n",
      "3. Dimensionality Reduction & Manifold Identification  \n",
      "   3.1. Apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify dominant modes of shape variation (expect 3–5 PCs capturing ≥80% variance).  \n",
      "   3.2. Use diffusion maps or UMAP to reveal nonlinear manifolds in the combined (shape+gene) space.  \n",
      "   3.3. Compute the local velocity field v(x)=dx/dt on the manifold via finite‐difference or Gaussian process regression.  \n",

      "       – A “tube” attractor underlies elongated, columnar hindgut cells.  \n",
      "   4.2. Identify separatrices that demarcate cell‐shape decision boundaries (e.g., which cells will invaginate vs. elongate).  \n",
      "   4.3. Use dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) to extract coherent spatiotemporal patterns (modes) of collective deformation.  \n",
      "\n",
      "5. Coupling Mechanics & Gene Regulation  \n",
      "   5.1. Estimate local cortical tension and bending energy from shape curvature and myosin II–GFP intensity (calibrated via laser‐ablation recoil experiments).  \n",
      "   5.2. Build a reduced vertex/continuum model in which gene‐expression level g modulates contractility λ(g).  \n",
      "   5.3. Simulate coupled ODE/PDE system:  \n",
      "       dx_i/dt = f_shape(x_i,g_i; λ)  \n",
      "       dg_i/dt = f_gene(g_i, signals(x_neighbors))  \n",

      "\n",
      "6. Predictive Perturbations & Validation  \n",
      "   6.1. In silico: perturb λ(g) or initial conditions on the manifold to predict shifts in fixed‐point locations or loss of separatrices.  \n",
      "   6.2. In vivo: use optogenetic activation of Rho1 or CRISPRi knockdown of byn to test model predictions on shape dynamics.  \n",
      "   6.3. Compare experimental trajectories with model forecasts via trajectory‐based metrics (e.g. dynamic time warping).  \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
