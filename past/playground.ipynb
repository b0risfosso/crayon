      "when they’re mounted in everyday rings. Diamonds with large fractures \n",

      "good clarity. One of the main advantages of buying diamonds for bridal \n",
      "rings, instead of other gems is that untreated diamonds are more resistant \n",
      "to abrasions and damage. They have withstood the test of time. \n",
      "Treated diamonds can be an affordable option to buying untreated \n",

      "Fracture filling, laser drilling and coatings can be detected by jewelers \n",
      "and appraisers. Accurate detection of irradiation and high temperature \n",
      "heat treatment normally requires the special expertise and sophisticated \n",
      "equipment of a qualified independent gem laboratory. An important \n",
      "reason for buying a diamond accompanied by a lab report is to verify that \n",
      "the diamond is untreated. Labs are able to identify the vast majority of \n",
      "treated diamonds, but some irradiated and HPHT diamonds are not \n",
      "detectable. Therefore if a lab does not have evidence proving a diamond is \n",
      "untreated, they include a statement such as “color origin undeterminable.” \n",
      "There are probably cases, however, where diamond color is misidentified \n",
      "as natural when in fact it’s the result of treatment. \n",
      "If you’re buying an untreated diamond, have it identified as untreated \n",
      "on the receipt. If a stone is identified as enhanced or processed, this means \n",
      "it is treated. Attractive untreated diamonds are still readily available. They \n",
