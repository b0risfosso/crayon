Each question ties back to one or more of the loci or processes in your table, points to a measurable imaging readout, and suggests what you would expect if the hypothesis is correct.\n",

      "1.    Primordium formation and maintenance (byn/Brachyury, fkh/HNF-3, wg/Wnt)  \n",
      "  •  Hypothesis: early wg and fkh activities are required to maintain the hindgut primordium by preventing apoptosis and driving cell internalization.  \n",
      "  •  Imaging assay: follow a byn>GFP or fkh>GFP reporter through gastrulation and early gut invagination.  Overlay with a live apoptosis marker (e.g. caspase sensor) and track cell delamination events.  \n",
      "  •  Readouts:  \n",

      "\n",
      "2.    Small intestine elongation (drm, lin, D/Sox, upd/JAK-STAT):  \n",
      "  •  Hypothesis A (drm, lin, D): these nuclear transcription factors coordinate polarized cell intercalation in the small intestine region.  \n",
      "  •  Imaging assay: use membrane label (e.g. E-cad::GFP) to segment individual epithelial cells in the elongating mid/hindgut.  Compute cell neighbor exchanges (“T1 transitions”), planar cell polarity (cell long axis orientation) over time in wild type and drm/lin/D mutants.  \n",

      "     –  Rate of T1 transitions per unit length.  \n",
      "     – Distribution of cell aspect ratios and their alignment with the AP axis.  \n",

      "     – Timing and extent of endocycles in large intestine cells in dpp mutants.  \n",

      "\n",
      "5.    Epithelial polarity and lumen morphology (crb, fas, rib):  \n",
      "  •  Hypothesis A (crb): Crumbs is required to establish apical surface and maintain epithelial integrity; its loss causes focal breaks and lumen collapse.  \n",
      "  •  Imaging assay: apical marker (aPKC::GFP) plus basolateral marker (Dlg::RFP) to report polarity in real time.  Examine crb mutants for junctional continuity and lumen cross-section.  \n",

      "  •  Expected: crb mutants show fragmented apical domain and focal lumen constrictions.\n",
      "\n",
      "  •  Hypothesis B (fas): Fas2-mediated adhesion is required to hold large intestine cells together under elongation tension.  \n",

      "\n",
      "6.    Cell division and cycle control (thr, phm/exo):  \n",
      "  •  Hypothesis A (thr): Thr is required for proper sister-chromatid separation during hindgut mitoses; its loss causes aneuploidy or mitotic delay.  \n",
      "  •  Imaging assay: label chromatin (H2A::GFP) and microtubules (Tubulin::RFP) to follow mitotic figures in vivo.  Measure mitotic duration, lagging chromosomes, cytokinesis failures in thr mutants.  \n",

      "  •  Expected: thr mutants show prolonged mitosis and increased chromosome segregation errors.\n",
      "\n",
      "  •  Hypothesis B (phm): Phm affects the number of cells contributing to elongation; loss causes altered cell-cycle exit or extra divisions yielding hypercurved gut.  \n",
      "  •  Imaging assay: count total epithelial cell number over time in exo mutants vs. control, track division planes orientation.  \n",
      "  •  Readouts: final cell count, spatial distribution of extra divisions, curvature quantification.  \n",
      "  •  Expected: exo mutants show extra divisions localized to a domain, resulting in localized bending.\n",
      "\n",
      "7.    RNA processing/spliceosome function (crn/yok):  \n",
      "  •  Hypothesis: Yok is required to process mRNAs that drive elongation; its loss yields narrow, rugose lumen due to mis-spliced adhesion or cytoskeletal regulators.  \n",
      "  •  Imaging assay: use a photoconvertible mRNA splicing reporter (if available) or co-image tagged cytoskeletal proteins (e.g. actin) in yok mutants, quantifying cell shape changes.  \n",
      "  •  Readouts: changes in cortical actin organization, cell height vs. width ratios, lumen surface roughness.  \n",
      "  •  Expected: yok mutants show altered cortical cytoskeleton, creating “rugose” lumen walls and impaired elongation.\n",
      "\n",
      "General strategy for all inquiries  \n",
      " •  Generate time-resolved, cell-level quantitative maps of (1) cell shape and neighbor topology, (2) division timing and orientation, (3) reporter activity for polarity/signaling/transcription, (4) apoptosis or extrusion events, and (5) tissue-level metrics (length, width, curvature).  \n",
      " •  For each gene/condition, compare these metrics to wild type using automated segmentation and tracking.  \n",
      " •  Link deviations directly to the hypothesized molecular function (e.g. decreased T1 intercalations when a TF for PCP is lost; failed apical constriction when Crumbs is missing).  \n",
      "\n",
      "By systematically pairing genetic perturbations with these live-imaging assays you will both test the roles suggested by the table and uncover the dynamic cellular behaviors that underlie hindgut morphogenesis.\n",

      " Below is a menu of hypothesis-driven questions you can attack with your 2D time-lapse of the hindgut apical surface, together with the key genetic perturbations and the kinds of measurements you would make in each case.  Most of these capitalize on your ability to segment and track every apical cell as the hindgut elongates and as boundary cells and the visceral-mesoderm interface form.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  Role of the “cassette” (byn/D, cad/Cdx, wg/Wnt, fkh/HNF-3) in convergent‐extension–type intercalations  \n",

      "\n",
      "2.  cad family in small-intestine domain elongation  \n",
      "    Hypothesis: cad mutants (7, 8; drm alleles) fail to repress a proximal transcriptional program and thus show broader, slower elongation.  \n",
      "    Experiment: image drm mutants (shorter, wider) and quantitate per-cell strain rates (Δlength/Δtime along A–P vs. D–V).  \n",
      "    Readout: reduced ΔAP strain coupled with increased ΔDV strain relative to WT.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  fkh/HNF-3 in epithelial survival and maintenance of apical area  \n",
      "    Hypothesis: in fkh mutants cells undergo apical contraction and delamination/apoptosis, halting elongation.  \n",
      "    Experiment: use a caspase‐reporter or nuclear fragmentation marker in fkh mutant movies and quantify the timing and location of cell loss.  Measure cell apical‐area trajectories preceding apoptosis.  \n",
      "    Readout: spikes of apical‐area collapse followed by disappearance, correlating with failed local extension.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  Boundary-cell specification (en, otp, Dl, Ser, hh)  \n",
      "    Hypothesis: Notch‐ and Hh-pathway inputs regulate when and where boundary cells emerge, and boundary cells have distinct intercalation dynamics.  \n",
      "    Experiment: in Dl or Ser mutants (extreme or normal boundary defects respectively), segment the boundary cell row(s) via an en>GFP or otp>GFP reporter.  Track their intercalation vs. neighbors and compare cell‐shape changes.  \n",
      "    Readout: in Dl mutants boundary cells fail to adopt elongated/tipped morphology and show aberrant neighbor‐exchange patterns.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  Visceral‐mesoderm→epithelium signaling (bap, hh, wg, dpp, upd)  \n",
      "    Hypothesis: signals from the visceral mesoderm polarize epithelial cells and orient their elongation.  \n",
      "    Experiment: label both tissues (e.g. Ecad–GFP in epithelium, Twist–RFP in mesoderm).  In bap or upd mutants (shorter, wider), test whether the onset of planar‐polarity (e.g. tricellular‐junction alignment) is lost/delayed.  \n",
      "    Readout: absence or reduction of global alignment of cell long axes towards the A–P axis.\n",
      "\n",
      "6.  Apical polarity (crb, raw, mmy)  \n",
      "    Hypothesis: crb is needed to maintain a coherent apical domain; loss leads to transient apical ruptures visible as holes or cell shape collapse.  \n",
      "    Experiment: in crb mutants, track apical junction continuity over time and quantify “gaps” or sudden changes in perimeter.  \n",
      "    Readout: increased frequency of apical discontinuities and associated local failure of elongation.\n",
      "\n",
      "7.  Cell‐division orientation (thr, rib)  \n",

      "\n",
      "8.  Lumen morphogenesis (crn/yok, phm/exo)  \n",

      "     •  Hypothesis: if the apical area is tightly constrained (large kV in the model), then you should see cell areas remaining near a constant value even under large curvature changes; if kB dominates, apical contours will distort more in high‐curvature zones.  \n",

      "     •  Hypothesis: if rotation is cell‐autonomous and driven by the internal balance of kS/kV/kB and T1 reconnection, then isolated explants should still rotate.  If the surrounding tissues supply essential forces, explants will fail to rotate.  \n",
      "     •  Measurement: take your 2D explant movies, unwrap and quantify rotation rate and cell rearrangements.  \n",

      "     •  Hypothesis: as shown by Hatori et al. 2014, intrinsic cell chirality can set the global handedness.  If you flip cell chirality genetically (e.g. alter specific cytoskeletal regulators), you should flip rotation direction.  \n",

      "     •  Hypothesis: the sum of area, perimeter, and bending energies (kS·(Sa–So)² + kV·(V–V0)² + kB·bending) should decrease over time as the tissue approaches its stable shape.  \n",
      "     •  Measurement: compute for each cell the deviation (Sa–So), the per-cell volume (approximated from apical area and known cell height), and local curvature; then sum these “energies” and see whether they monotonically decrease towards your observed final configuration.  \n",
      "     •  Perturbation: transiently block any one energy term (e.g. inhibit volume regulation by osmotic shock) and see if the system fails to relax its total energy as your model would predict.\n",
