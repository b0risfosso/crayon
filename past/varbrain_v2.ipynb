      "The excerpt discusses the complex dynamics of bioelectric circuits, which operate independently from the genetic sequences that code for them. Unlike genetic or molecular profiles, the bioelectric state depends on the voltage regulation of ion channels and gap junctions (GJs), which can exist in different physiological states despite identical genetic makeups. This emphasizes the departure from traditional biology, which relies heavily on genetic and molecular data to determine cell state. Bioelectric networks offer robust physiological states and respond to disruptions with adaptive patterning, enabling evolutionary resilience through modular bioelectric functions. These systems function as \"master regulators,\" dictating extensive developmental pathways from simple inputs. Furthermore, the study suggests that DNA could be seen as specifying the hardware, with bioelectric activities acting as software, analogous to computing. Exploring these bioelectric properties provides insights into evolution, development, and the potential role of commensal species in modifying host organism growth. Better understanding may lead to applications in biomedicine and synthetic bioengineering. Additionally, the glossary clarifies various technical terms, such as gap junctions and axial polarity, while funding and acknowledgments are detailed for the research.\n"
