      "The excerpt discusses research on Drosophila hindgut morphogenesis, focusing on two distinct cellular and junctional dynamics—cell sliding and cell intercalation. The excerpt highlights several experimental findings: E-cad mutant and Myo1D-overexpressing embryos exhibit different cell dynamics, with E-cad mutants showing no significant change in cell intercalation but altered cell boundary rotation. Conversely, embryos overexpressing Myo1D show an enhanced bias in cell boundary rotation. It suggests that cell sliding and intercalation are independent processes. Par-3/baz mutants exhibit defects in hindgut elongation due to reduced intercalation, while sliding and rotation remain unaffected. These findings imply that different genetic and cellular influences distinctly regulate the two mechanisms, underlying their concurrent but independent execution. Additionally, a computational model suggests these dynamics are supported by contractile forces with different polarities, indicating a complex integration of rotational and elongational processes in hindgut epithelium morphogenesis.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The excerpt discusses mechanisms underlying the formation of the ventral furrow (VF) in developing tissues, emphasizing the role of pulsed contractions of the medial actomyosin network, which trigger transient constrictions stabilized by the cytoskeletal cortex. The authors propose an alternative understanding using the Active Tension Network (ATN) model, suggesting that the VF formation involves isogonal deformations driven by medial myosin pulses. Their investigations reveal a near-zero log χ distribution in mesoderm tissues, indicating approximate tension balance. Time-lapse imaging supports the ATN model by showing consistent cortical myosin levels and edge orientations. Analyzing VF movies reveals that isogonal deformations align with ∼85% of cell displacements. Discussing snail and twist mutants shows how these genetic differences impact contraction and tension dynamics, highlighting the role of pressure and restoring force in limiting isogonal deformations. The ATN model posits three processes—fast relaxation to mechanical equilibrium, myosin-driven cortical rearrangements, and slow dynamic myosin recruitment—explaining tissue behavior across different timescales. This explanation underscores the importance of external stress support and the need for further experimentation to test the dynamic recruitment hypothesis.\n"

The gentle pulls and twists each cell experiences, much like the rhythmic tug-of-war described in the ATN model, lead to elegant curves and turns shaping the final structure. Just as a dance is choreographed with precise pulses of energy and tension, the hindgut finds its form through the smooth interplay of independent, but intertwined, cellular movements. Here, the harmony of nature and physics orchestrates life’s breathtaking morphogenesis, one graceful step at a time.\n"

Over 60 minutes, individual cell boundaries swivel around the tube’s long axis—dextral chirality emerges as red-stained edges rotate counterclockwise, propelling the entire gut into a rightward coil. When E-cad is lost, boundaries slip without torque and rotation bias vanishes; when Myo1D is overabundant, junctions spin more vigorously, exaggerating the twist.

      "Within the intricate dance of Drosophila's hindgut morphogenesis, the choreography of cell boundary rotation plays a critical role. E-cadherin (E-cad) and Myosin 1D (Myo1D) preside over this molecular ballet, dictating the rotation direction and frequency of cell boundaries. These rotations, measured as counterclockwise (ccw) or clockwise (cw), influence hindgut dynamics. In the E-cad mutants, the usual left-right (LR) bias in rotations vanishes, whereas in Myo1D-overexpressing embryos, the bias amplifies. Through this rotational mechanism, cells are not merely positioned but are tasked with ensuring proper tissue configuration critical for developmental processes like hindgut rotation.\n",

      "    •  In myo1d morphants or mutants, repeat vacuole counts and trajectory analysis.  \n",

      "3.  Actomyosin and anterior–posterior cell‐shape changes  \n",
      "    Hypothesis: ROCK–Myosin II–dependent cortical tension sculpts an AP gradient of epithelial cell shape.  Anterior cells remain columnar, posterior cells become squamous.  \n",

      "    Hypothesis: vesicle fusion to the apical membrane occurs at spatial “hotspots” and in temporal bursts that cause stepwise lumen expansions.  \n",
