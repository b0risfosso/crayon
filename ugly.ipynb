      "Here are a handful of hypothesis‐driven questions you could explore with a 3D‐time‐lapse (lightsheet) dataset of zebrafish hindgut (or KV) morphogenesis.  In each case you would define a treatment or mutant (e.g. myo1d–/–, cftr–/–, pharmacological perturbation) and then use the lightsheet volumes to extract quantitative readouts (lumen size, cell shapes/volumes, cilia behavior, rotation, etc.) over time.\n",

      "\n",
      "3.  Apicobasal cell‐shape changes driving tube curvature  \n",
      "   •  Hypothesis: directional curvature (leftward tilt/looping) of the hindgut arises from differential apical constriction on one side.  \n",
      "   •  What to do: segment individual epithelial cells, measure apical surface area vs basal area on the left and right sides over time, and correlate with global bending angle or rotation of the tube.\n",

      "   •  What to do: in embryos treated with blebbistatin (or rock2b morphants) vs controls, quantify cell-shape metrics (aspect ratio, circularity) during the rosette-to-tube transition, and measure timing/dynamics of lumen opening.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  Cell proliferation vs cell rearrangement in tube elongation  \n",
      "   •  Hypothesis: elongation of the hindgut tube is driven more by oriented cell division than by cell intercalation.  \n",
      "   •  What to do: with a nuclear marker you can 4D‐track divisions.  Score mitotic axis orientation relative to the AP axis, quantify rate of new cell addition versus neighbor‐exchange events (T1 transitions).\n",
      "\n",
      "6.  Asymmetric cell packing and neighbor number  \n",
      "   •  Hypothesis: left vs right sides of the hindgut epithelium differ in cell‐packing geometry, which biases morphological rotation.  \n",

      "9.  Ciliogenesis in the hindgut and its relation to flow  \n",
      "   •  Hypothesis: motile cilia appear on hindgut epithelial cells in a stage-dependent manner and are required for establishing fluid flow.  \n",
      "   •  What to do: label acetylated tubulin or Arl13b in live embryos, segment and count cilia number/length on each cell, map their orientation, and relate that to bead‐track flow data and downstream LR gene expression (e.g. spaw/dand5).\n",
      "\n",
      "10. Left–right gene expression dynamics in situ  \n",
      "   •  Hypothesis: asymmetrically generated mechanical or flow cues in the hindgut produce first an asymmetric dand5 domain, then lateral spaw activation.  \n",
      "   •  What to do: combine your light‐sheet imaging with fluorescent in situ hybridization for dand5 and spaw at successive somite stages.  Segment the expression domains (voxels), measure their volumes/intensities on left vs right, and overlay that with your morphological maps.\n",
      "\n",
      "11.  Endocytic vs secretory trafficking contributions  \n",
      "   •  Hypothesis: apical‐targeted secretory vesicles (Rab8/Rab11 positive) versus endocytic (Rab5) have distinct roles in lumen fluid and membrane delivery.  \n",
      "   •  What to do: generate transgenic reporters for Rab proteins, do dual‐color light‐sheet imaging, track vesicle subpopulations, quantify their fusion rates with the apical membrane.\n",
      "\n",
      "12.  Coupling of extracellular matrix remodeling to tube shaping  \n",
      "   •  Hypothesis: localized deposition or remodeling of basement‐membrane (laminin, fibronectin) guides epithelial cell rearrangements.  \n",
      "   •  What to do: image a fluorescent ECM reporter or immuno-label time-series, segment the ECM layer thickness/intensity, and correlate local ECM density changes with epithelial cell‐shape or neighbor changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each of these inquiries begins with a clear, testable statement (“If X is true then we expect to see…”) and then uses the 4D geometry (cell shapes, lumen morphology), dynamics (vesicle tracks, bead flow), and molecular reporters (junction proteins, cilia, polarity markers) that are readily extracted from a light‐sheet dataset.  Depending on your existing labels you can adapt one or more of these to rigorously connect molecular drivers (e.g. Myo1d, Rock2b, ion channels) to the biomechanics and morphodynamics of hindgut development.\n",
      "Below is a non‐exhaustive list of hypothesis–driven questions and the sorts of measurements you could pull out of a 4D light‐sheet (“SPIM”) movie of Drosophila hindgut development when you have fluorescent Myo1D- and Myo1C-HaloTag constructs (and tailswaps, RNAi, etc.) in hand.  In each case you would be correlating the biophysical parameters (diffusion coefficient, dwell time, membrane‐association fraction) you already measured in cultured macrophages with actual tissue morphogenesis in the embryo.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  Tail-domain control of morphogenetic rotation  \n",
      "    Hypothesis:  The slower diffusion coefficient conferred by the Myo1C tail (or by the Myo1C head) imparts a higher “friction” at the apical membrane, biasing cells to generate sinistral (left-handed) curvature during hindgut looping.  \n",
      "    Experiment / readout:  \n",
      "    •  Express full-length Myo1D-HaloTag, full-length Myo1C-HaloTag, and the tail-swap chimeras (Myo1Dhead–Myo1CIQtail and Myo1Chead–Myo1DIQtail) under the hindgut-specific GAL4 driver.  \n",
      "    •  Collect 4D SPIM stacks from stage 12 through stage 16 (when the hindgut makes its first loop).  \n",
      "    •  Segment the epithelial tube, extract the instantaneous tube curvature and torsion, and plot how it changes over time in each genotype.  \n",
      "    •  Ask whether the constructs that show “fast” diffusion in culture (Myo1D tail) produce a more dextral bend, and those with “slow” diffusion (Myo1C tail) produce a more sinistral bend.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  Correlation of single-molecule dynamics with local curvature or cell shape  \n",
      "    Hypothesis:  Myo1C’s prolonged head-domain binding to F-actin leads to longer membrane residency at cell-cell junctions under mechanical tension (e.g. the convex vs. concave side of the loop).  \n",
      "    Experiment / readout:  \n",
      "    •  Use sparse photoactivation or very low–density HaloTag labeling so that you can track single Myo1D- or Myo1C-HaloTag molecules in the intact hindgut epithelium.  \n",
      "    •  From the SPIM time series, compute local curvature of the epithelial sheet and bin your single‐molecule events by curvature (concave side vs. convex side of the tube).  \n",
      "    •  Measure dwell times and diffusion coefficients in those bins.  Do you see longer dwell times (lower D) on the convex side for Myo1C but not Myo1D?\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  Temporal emergence of diffusion differences relative to the onset of chirality  \n",
      "    Hypothesis:  The distinct diffusion/dissociation properties of Myo1D vs. Myo1C only appear (or become accentuated) at the onset of handed rotation.  \n",
      "    Experiment / readout:  \n",
      "    •  Quantify membrane–cytoplasm exchange (FRAP or single‐molecule off‐rates) of Myo1D- and Myo1C-HaloTag at multiple developmental time points (e.g. stage 11, 12, 13…).  \n",
      "    •  Overlay those kinetic parameters on your timeline of hindgut twisting onset.  \n",
      "    •  Ask whether the diffusion gaps between Myo1D and Myo1C open up right before or during the first detectable tissue rotation.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  Functional antagonism in vivo  \n",
      "    Hypothesis:  Although Myo1D and Myo1C do not alter each other’s diffusion when co‐expressed in macrophages, they may compete for limited membrane‐lipid or actin–binding sites in the hindgut epithelium, altering cell rearrangement dynamics.  \n",
      "    Experiment / readout:  \n",
      "    •  Perform single or double knockdowns (Myo1C RNAi, Myo1D RNAi, or both) in the hindgut and record developmental movies.  \n",
      "    •  Use cell‐centroid tracking to extract rates of neighbor‐exchange (T1) events in the epithelium.  \n",
      "    •  Test whether loss of Myo1C speeds up neighbor rearrangements (consistent with a faster‐diffusing Myo1D dominating), or vice versa.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  Lipid microdomain dependence in situ  \n",
      "    Hypothesis:  The tail‐domain differences in Myo1D vs. Myo1C diffusion stem from different affinities for PIP₂ or other phosphoinositides, and those lipids are nonuniformly distributed along the hindgut.  \n",
      "    Experiment / readout:  \n",
      "    •  Co‐image Myo1D-HaloTag or Myo1C-HaloTag with a PIP₂ sensor (e.g. PH-GFP) in the hindgut.  \n",
      "    •  Map 3D PIP₂ intensity and correlate it with local myosin diffusion or dwell times.  \n",
      "    •  Perturb PIP₂ levels (via an inducible 5-phosphatase) and ask how membrane‐residence kinetics and overall tissue handedness change.\n",
      "\n",
      "6.  Head vs. tail domain contributions to subcellular localization  \n",
      "    Hypothesis:  The head and tail domains of Myo1C each contribute to a particular subcellular compartment (e.g. tricellular junctions vs. bicellular junctions) and these micro‐compartments are key for generating asymmetry.  \n",
      "    Experiment / readout:  \n",
      "    •  Express the domain-swap constructs in the hindgut and do super-resolution SPIM (or lattice light sheet) to see whether they preferentially localize to junctions, medial apical cortex, basal cortex, etc.  \n",

      "8.  Population‐level cooperativity or clustering  \n",
      "    Hypothesis:  The tail domain of Myo1C promotes the formation of small membrane clusters that reduce apparent diffusion, and these clusters act as focal points to initiate tissue rotation.  \n",

      "\n",
      "10.  A priori prediction of twist direction from myosin kinetics  \n",
      "    Hypothesis:  If you know the ratio of fast vs. slow diffusion states in a given cell, you can predict whether that cell will contribute to a rightward vs. leftward turn when the tube forms.  \n",

      "All of these rely on extracting exactly the same parameters you already have in culture (diffusion coefficients in “fast” vs. “slow” states, dwell times, membrane‐vs.-cytosol fractions) but now mapped back onto the morphogenetic process in vivo.  You can test domain-swap constructs, RNAi knockdowns, lipid perturbations, mechanical assays, multicolor cytoskeleton imaging, and single‐molecule vs. population‐level clustering, always tying back to a precise hypothesis about how head- or tail-driven changes in biophysical kinetics of Myo1D/C underlie the chirality of the hindgut.\n",

      "\n",
      "9.  Does the extracellular matrix (ECM) or basal lamina reorganize during rotation?  \n",

      "Below are five illustrative avenues, each with a sample hypothesis and a sketch of how you’d test it.  None of them is guaranteed to succeed, but they at least steer you into the realm of rigorous, falsifiable inquiry:\n",
      "\n",
      "1) Zero-Point (Vacuum) Energy via Casimir-Type Geometries  \n",
      "   • Hypothesis H₁: A non-reciprocal, time-modulated “Casimir cavity” can in net do positive work by rectifying vacuum fluctuations.  \n",
      "   • Test plan:  \n",
      "     – Build two precisely machined, conducting plates whose separation you can modulate at high frequency.  \n",
      "     – Isolate thermally and in high vacuum (≤10⁻⁷ Pa).  \n",
      "     – Use a sensitive torsion balance or MEMS cantilever to measure torque or force where no external power is fed into the modulation beyond what’s needed to drive the plates.  \n",
      "     – Account for every joule you put in. If you get more work out than you put in, you’ve falsified H₀.\n",

      "2) Dynamical Boundary Conditions & Photon Production (Dynamical Casimir Effect)  \n",
      "   • Hypothesis H₂: Rapidly changing boundary conditions in a superconducting microwave cavity can spontaneously emit real photons in excess of the supplied drive energy.  \n",

      "5) Room-Temperature “Cold Fusion” / Low-Energy Nuclear Reactions (LENR)  \n",

Every attempt to do so falls afoul of the laws of thermodynamics and conservation of energy.  Here is why—and what you can do instead if you need very large or very long-lived power supplies:\n",

      "    •  Energy can neither be created nor destroyed in an isolated system.  \n",

      "    •  Even tapping exotic ideas (Maxwell’s demon, zero-point or vacuum energy, unconventional quantum effects) has never yielded a provable net energy gain.  All so-called free-energy schemes either repackage input energy or are based on overlooked losses and have failed experimental testing.\n",

      "    c. Nuclear Fusion (Future Promise)  \n",
      "       – Deuterium-tritium fusion or advanced aneutronic reactions have enormous energy density (E=mc²), but still finite fuel.  \n",

      "On the Genealogy of Morality\n",
      "Friedrich Nietzsche opens by tracing the seeds of On the Genealogy of Morality back to reflections first sparked in the winter of 1876–77—and even earlier, to a childhood preoccupation with the origin of evil. He stresses that, as a philosopher, his ideas are not random but grow organically from a single “will to knowledge.” Early on he learned to separate theological from moral questions and, through studies in history and philology, turned his attention to how human beings invented the value‐judgments “good” and “evil” and what consequences these judgments have for human flourishing or decline.  \n",
      "\n",
      "A turning point came with Paul Rée’s 1877 book The Origin of the Moral Sensations, whose provocative, genealogical approach Nietzsche both challenged and refined in his own earlier writings (Human, All Too Human; Daybreak; The Wanderer). Yet beneath questions of historical hypothesis lay his deeper concern: the value of morality itself—especially the altruism and compassion so extolled by Schopenhauer. Nietzsche came to see self‐denial and pity not as life‐affirming virtues but as symptoms of cultural weakness, even nihilism. Pointing out that classical thinkers such as Plato, Spinoza, La Rochefoucauld, and Kant all held compassion in low regard, he ultimately issues a call for a thorough “critique of moral values”—an inquiry into the origins, transformations, and real effects of our moral concepts, seen variously as symptoms, masks, remedies, or poisons of life.\n"

Piezo mats  in high traffic ~1–2 W continuous. RF scavenging ~10–20 mW. Combined, a desktop‐scale system (~1 m² area, a small vent, a few TEG attachments) can sustainably output 150–200 W around the clock. Scale surface area or add nodes to approach kilowatt+ territory.\n",
