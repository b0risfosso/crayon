One, two, one, two, one, two, one, two
One, two, one, two, one, two, one, two
One, two, one, two, one, two, one, two
One, two, one, two, one, two, one, two
One, two before three like two-three when it hits third
That '92, that '93 season, crowned a new king
The kid came and proceeded, no prodigee-I-D
More prime time with the lines, you know I'm fine in press defense
Isolated on the island silent with Selassie
My new target Lisa Leslie, look like Lisa Left Eye
Gave me food for thought that mental appetite, it fed I
Can't tell you what was said 'cause at the less could get us fed time
I read between the rhymes and saw the lies and looks in niggas eyes
When I arrive, you saw a robber rise, and now it's ride or die 'til all the writers die
Rise and shine, sun creepin' in from behind the blinds
Destiny's child, and he brought the ambiance
Say that I'm beyond (beyond), the normal rom-a-com you find
Fasted with mustafa, solidarity for Ramadan
I'm tryna clear my mind, searchin' for somethin', see a sign
Prayin' God stand by my side 'til we realign
Uh, yeah, uh-uh, yeah, uh-huh, yeah, uh
Life caught me slippin', now I need my fair one, uh
Days creep by, gettin' hard to share one, uh
Might hold space, but I never cared once, no
Blazing, we might set it all on fire
Got a scotty, gon' beam me up, don't fuck up my high
Bro said he cut from the cloth, it's all a disguise
I see it in they eyes (look, uh), see it in they smiles, see it in they (frowns)
As the seventh sun orbits 'round the Earth
Know the first becomes the last and then the last will be the first
Like my future and my past is set forth, must reverse
Do the math, I ain't too great with that, I found a way with words
Just a wayward son that made his way from out the dirt, the road was unpaved
Through the pain and hurt, we showed up unscathed
Put it in layman's terms, I'm so unafraid
I showed 'em my rage, the hate done raised up into my shoulder blades
Sure you ain't safe
I been the king, but I still roll with my ace
I read that book before, I know the page you on
I seen that look before, got what you lookin' for
Hard-headed, mama said what I got whoopings for
Niggas tried to play me like a ho, we get to hookin'
Never had shit but bad shit, so we took it
Look it, seen 12 come, I'm 'bout to book it
Push the fuckin' pack off of the porch, you fuckin' pussy
Hop out the bushed, buss it, I'm on some bullshit
I'm on some niggas, fuck the rules, shit
I said my prayer inside the pulpit
Then fool prevent my defense with a full blitz
Tryin' to take a mile, couldn't move an inch
Shit was too intense, now I'm tryna get back to the root of it
Elementary, my dear, the rudiments
Penitentiary, free all the hooligans
My mind scattered brain just like me, Conway and Ludacris
I really do this shit like it's my diligent duty
But I see you comparin' me to certain people
It's rude, and I feel stupid as-
I had enough of the foolishness
Dump truck dumpin' out the trash, but I'm improvin' on my craft
And I been cruisin' down this path
I took a bruisin', I just laughed and keep it movin'
I ain't mad at none of you, this shit amusin', it's just music and I love it
So I lose it when they leave me out the loop of who's the truest
Who's who, and I'm just here like "Yoo-hoo?"
It's been a lot of years, huh? Shed a lot of tears too
The man in the mirror is merely more than the miracle
RIP to BJ Frazier, we still feel your spirit, it's bigger than physical
Uh, yeah, uh-uh, yeah, uh-huh, yeah, uh
Life caught me slippin', now I need my fair one, uh
Days creep by, gettin' hard to share one, uh
Might hold space, but I never cared once, no
Blazing, we might set it all on fire
Got a scotty, gon' beam me up, don't fuck up my high
Bro said he cut from the cloth, it's all a disguise
I see it in they eyes, see it in they smiles, see it in they (frowns)
