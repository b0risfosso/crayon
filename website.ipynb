      "Below is a high-level, step-by-step roadmap for building your “Interactive Case Explorer.” You can adapt language and tools to your team’s preferences.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Project Scoping & Data Requirements  \n",
      "   • Define the fields you need: date, region, target state, policy goal, outcome, action type, target capability, allies present, U.S. election year, etc.  \n",
      "   • Identify your data sources (e.g. declassified DoD records, academic datasets, news archives).  \n",
      "   • Sketch wireframes showing map view, filters sidebar, and time-series charts.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Data Collection & Preparation  \n",
      "   • Ingest raw data from spreadsheets, APIs, PDFs, or CSV dumps.  \n",
      "   • Clean and normalize: unify date formats, standardize country/region codes, map synonyms for policy goals and outcomes.  \n",
      "   • Tag each record with derived fields: decade, election-year flag, ally-presence boolean.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Database & Geospatial Setup  \n",
      "   • Choose a database: PostgreSQL with PostGIS for GIS support.  \n",
      "   • Design tables:  \n",
      "     – actions (id, date, region_id, target_state_id, …)  \n",
      "     – regions (id, name, geometry)  \n",
      "     – states (id, name, ISO code)  \n",
      "     – allies (action_id, ally_id)  \n",
      "     – look-up tables for action types, policy goals, outcomes.  \n",
      "   • Load region geometries (e.g. GeoJSON for world boundaries, U.S. election maps).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Backend API Development  \n",
      "   • Pick a framework: Flask/FastAPI (Python) or Express (Node.js).  \n",
      "   • Build endpoints for:  \n",
      "     – /actions?filters… returns paged action records  \n",
      "     – /stats/time-series?by=action_type,decade  \n",
      "     – /map/data?filters… returns GeoJSON aggregated by region or state  \n",
      "   • Implement filtering logic server-side to handle combinations of dates, types, capabilies, allies, election years.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Aggregations & Metrics  \n",
      "   • In the backend or via materialized views, compute pre-aggregated tables for:  \n",
      "     – success rates per action type by decade  \n",
      "     – count of operations by region/date/policy goal.  \n",
      "   • Expose these via dedicated API endpoints for fast chart drawing.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Front-End Framework & Structure  \n",
      "   • Choose a modern JS stack: React, Vue, or Angular.  \n",
      "   • Structure pages/components:  \n",
      "     – FilterPanel (date picker, dropdowns, checkboxes)  \n",
      "     – MapView (Mapbox GL or Leaflet)  \n",
      "     – ChartView (D3.js, Chart.js or Recharts)  \n",
      "     – DataTable (optional detailed list).\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Interactive Map Implementation  \n",
      "   • Integrate Mapbox GL JS or Leaflet.  \n",
      "   • Fetch GeoJSON from your /map/data endpoint.  \n",
      "   • Style regions by number of actions or success rate (choropleth).  \n",
      "   • Add tooltips or popups showing summary stats when the user hovers or clicks.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Filter Controls & State Management  \n",
      "   • Use a state store (Redux/Vuex or React Context) to keep current filters.  \n",
      "   • On any filter change, refire API requests to:  \n",
      "     – the /actions endpoint (for table or map markers)  \n",
      "     – the /map/data endpoint (to recolor map)  \n",
      "     – the /stats/time-series endpoint (to redraw charts).\n",
      "\n",
      "9. Time-Series Charts  \n",
      "   • Implement line or bar charts for success rate vs. decade and for different action types.  \n",
      "   • Bind to the same filter state so charts update in real time.  \n",
      "   • Add tooltips, legends, and axis labels.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. UI Polishing & Responsive Design  \n",
      "   • Ensure controls and visuals work on desktop and tablets (mobile if needed).  \n",
      "   • Add loading spinners for data fetches.  \n",
      "   • Provide “Reset filters” and “Download CSV” options.\n",
      "\n",
      "11. Testing & Performance Tuning  \n",
      "   • Backend: unit tests for each API endpoint and filter combination.  \n",
      "   • Frontend: component tests plus end-to-end tests (Cypress or Selenium).  \n",
      "   • Optimize database: indexes on date, action_type, region_id; cache frequent queries or use Redis.\n",
      "\n",
      "12. Deployment & Monitoring  \n",
      "   • Containerize with Docker.  \n",
      "   • Host backend and database on AWS/GCP/Azure (e.g. ECS/Fargate or Kubernetes).  \n",
      "   • Serve frontend via a CDN (Netlify, S3+CloudFront).  \n",
      "   • Set up logging (ELK stack) and performance monitoring (Prometheus, New Relic).  \n",
      "   • Automate CI/CD pipelines so pushing to main triggers build, test, and deploy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Optional Enhancements  \n",
      "• User authentication for saving custom filter presets.  \n",
      "• Annotations or case summaries drawn on the map.  \n",
      "• Exportable PDF/PNG snapshots of charts/maps.  \n",
      "• Story-telling mode highlighting key decades or case studies.\n",
      "\n",
      "By following these steps—data modeling, API design, interactive front-end, and solid DevOps—you’ll have a robust, filterable map and dashboard for exploring U.S. military actions over time.\n"
