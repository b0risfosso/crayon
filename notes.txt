inject various colors on the painting and see if you paint the picture that you like. 
how does this entity react to xyz, a manufacturing company, a international treaty, a dataset, an LLM. do I have these colors? how do I get these colors? 
more entities. entities that you have access to? What can the entity: a ton of sand do within this subentity. this list of subentities is not the entire set of subentities in this picture.
the color palette is much more subtle. much more dynamic. an codebase that does xyz is also an entity, a part of the picture: a partnership is another set of entities...
the internet is another color. twitter is another color. build more colors. the picture is dynamic. the picture is uncertain. the picture is infinitely complex, infinitely simple. what is the color of xyz? 
I have all the colors needed to paint this picture tomorrow. all colors find themselves within the picture if you search for them. for the colors, search for the picture. search for the perfect relationship between the two.
colors grow into picture. picture grows into color. 
flow with the picture. 

thought: when you flip the light switch, the light turns on.
simulation: the simulation runs a room and a light connected to a switch. when you flip the light switch in sim, the light turns on.
theory: based on xyz, when you flip the light switch, the light turns on.
physical world: when your hand physically flips the light switch, the light turns on.
