      "This excerpt discusses the genetic factors involved in organ development, particularly focusing on the development and patterning of the hindgut in Drosophila as a model. The text highlights the roles of various genes and signaling pathways in establishing the anterior-posterior (AP) and dorsal-ventral (DV) axes necessary for organ formation, including the pancreas, lungs, and thyroid. While Hox-C genes are important for vertebrate and Drosophila midgut development, they are less significant in Drosophila hindgut development. Instead, non-HoxC homeodomain genes like cad, bap, and engrailed (en) are involved. The patterning of the hindgut into distinct domains such as small and large intestines depends on various genes like drm, bowl, lin, and signaling pathways like JAK/STAT. The excerpt also covers Drosophila's left-right asymmetry, discussing its genetic basis compared to other organisms and noting the importance of studies on live cell movements to understand these developmental mechanisms.\n"

      "The excerpt explores the distinction between the narrative self and the processes that shape self-representation within the framework of the Free Energy Principle (FEP). It suggests that the narrative self is not the central driver of cognition but a constructed representation influenced by meta-level processes. Self-evidencing, a process central to active inference, targets not the narrative self but the environment observing the system overall. The excerpt highlights cognitive biases and confabulations in self-knowledge, indicating that individuals often rely on shared theories rather than actual causes when explaining their behaviors. The concept of the Cognitive Light Cone (CLC) and the Technological Approach to Mind Everywhere (TAME) are introduced to describe the limits on goals and competencies that systems can represent and pursue. It emphasizes the physical and enactive nature of cognition, pointing out fundamental limitations on self-representation due to system-environment boundaries. The narrative discusses the implications of these ideas on neuroscience, cognition, and broader areas like legal and ethical theories, and it argues against the notion of centralized control in favor of distributed cognition systems.\n"
