Objective
To harness, measure, and store a discrete packet of 1 megajoule (MJ) of energy across multiple possible mediums (solar, mechanical, thermal, chemical, biological, human), thereby constructing both a symbolic and practical foundation for energy mastery in the Fantasiagenesis system.
Hypothesis
If 1 MJ of energy can be harnessed, tracked, and stored across different mediums with clear equivalences (e.g., lifting weights, burning ethanol, charging a battery, pedaling a bike), then energy becomes modular, interchangeable, and narratively scalable—unlocking the ability to engineer higher-order goals (10 MJ, 100 MJ, 1000 MJ) and connect human, biological, and technological systems into a unified energetic framework.
Protocol
Define Mediums
Solar: ~278 Wh captured from ~2 m² PV in a sunny day.
Mechanical: raising 100 kg mass × 100 lifts (≈ 1 MJ).
Thermal: heat ~240 L of water by 1 °C.
Chemical: burn ~37 g of ethanol (~1 MJ).
Biological: estimate ATP turnover equivalent in a cell population.
Human: ~1 hour of pedaling a stationary bike.
Measurement & Instrumentation
Use calibrated sensors (watt-meters, temperature probes, force sensors, calorimeters).
Log data in a structured database (energy_input, energy_output, efficiency, timestamp).
Storage/Equivalence Mapping
Translate all harnessed energy into a common unit (MJ, Wh, kcal).
Store results in a ledger (e.g., energy.html or SQLite table).
Iteration
Run each modality at least once.
Compare measured output to theoretical equivalence.
Identify inefficiencies and losses.
Success Criteria
At least 1 MJ harnessed and verified via multiple methods of measurement (calorimetry, electrical logging, mechanical work).
All modalities mapped into a single equivalence framework (e.g., 1 MJ = 278 Wh = 240 kcal = 100 lifts of 100 kg by 1 m).
Data stored and accessible for future scaling toward 100 MJ and 1000 MJ goals.
Protocol replicable by others, with defined BOM (bill of materials) and instrumentation.</pre>
