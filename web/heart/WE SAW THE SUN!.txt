Whoa!
Suns coming out and I still feel numb
In the dark my secrets hide, I run!
A few more drops upon your tongue
A night to remember that can't be undone

Head spun, meanwhile you're done
Had a little too much fun
I can not stop touching you
This just took my high to the moon! (Whoa!)

It don't get no better
Moments like this reveal the truth
Alone with only you
Take a picture 'cause we'll need proof
Nobody will believe we saw the sun
If this don't work out remember what we've done!

It don't get no better!
Take a picture, 'cause we'll need proof!
Nobody will believe we saw the sun!
If it don't work out remember what we've done!

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Just let your imagination run wild
Let your heart be your guide
And the time you sat around worrying about it and trying to plan out painting
You could have completed a painting already
Let it happen
Let it happen
And I would spend sometimes weeks, just working on a picture drawing it out getting all the little sketches and stuff
And then I'd go back and spend maybe a month trying to fill in the blocks
And here we let it happen, it comes from up here
It's in you, and you put it on the canvas, okay?
Let's see
