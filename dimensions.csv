Energy markets, food supplies, and alliances worldwide are tied to its outcome.","Fantasiagenesis creates narratives of civilian protection: evacuation corridors, demining, critical infrastructure defense; military resilience: supply chains, air defense systems, intelligence sharing; diplomatic fronts: NATO cohesion, EU enlargement, global sanctions enforcement; economic stabilization: energy diversification, grain export corridors, reconstruction planning; accountability: war crimes documentation, prosecution, and historical record-keeping; long-term peace: security guarantees, demilitarized zones, reintegration of displaced populations"
